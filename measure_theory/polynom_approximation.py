"""Solution to the following exercise (paraphrased):
Write a program that, for a given fâˆˆL^2([-1,1]) and given Degree n, finds the unique polynom p with
    ||f-p|| <= ||f-q|| (in the L^2-Norm)
for all Polynomials q with degree <= n. Test it for different n on the function f(x)=log(|x|)

This is done via the legendre polynomials, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials"""
